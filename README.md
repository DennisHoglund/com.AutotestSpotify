Autotest of the Spotify client with Sikuli

This project uses Sikuli/Java to test the Spotify client. Testcases are executet via TestNG. I've created two Java-classes:
* LoginPage
* MainPage

LoginPage handles log in of the Spotify client and returns a MainPage if needed.

MainPage handles search of song, artist and log out.
